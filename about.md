Hi! I'm Thomas, an MSci Physics student studying at [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ac.uk/), interested in plasma physics, laboratory astrophysics, astrophysics, and instrumentation.

For my MSci research project, I'm utilising data from [ESA's Herschel Space Observatory](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/home) to study the early history of dusty star-forming galaxies. The *Herschel* mission has long been decommissioned (~2010), so we're applying some fancy techniques to *squeeze* out as much science as we can from the legacy observations.

Outside of physics, I enjoy making things! Be sure to check out my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}) page for updates on this sort of thing.

For a summary of my CV, see my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin }}) page.

If you'd like to contact me feel free to send me an email or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}).
