Hi! I'm Thomas, an undergraduate physics student studying at [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ac.uk/), interested in astrophysics and instrumentation. Currently, I'm finishing the third year of my degree and will be starting my MSci research project soon. After this, *who knows!* But, I'm aiming to study for a PhD once I've graduated. Stay tuned! 

Outside of physics, I enjoy making things: check out my [Blog]({{ site.url }}/blog) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}) page for updates on this sort of thing.

For a summary of my CV, see my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin }}) page.

If you'd like to contact me feel free to send me an email or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}).
