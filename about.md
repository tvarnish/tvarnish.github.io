Hi! I'm Thomas, a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering ([NSE](http://web.mit.edu/nse/)) at MIT. My research---at the [PSFC](https://www.psfc.mit.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Jack Hare](https://www.jackdhare.net/)---revolves around astrophysically-relevant fundamental plasma physics. Right now, I'm studying experimental pulsed-power driven magnetic reconnection in the presence of a guide field, on machines such as [PUFFIN](https://puffin.ece.cornell.edu/), [MAIZE](https://plasmabay.engin.umich.edu/research/michigan-accelerator-for-inductive-z-pinch-experiments-maize/), and [COBRA](https://www.lps.cornell.edu/). Generally speaking, my research interests lie at the intersection of plasma physics, laboratory astrophysics, astrophysics (the won't-fit-in-a-lab kind), and instrumentation.

In 2021, I completed my undergraduate MSci degree in Physics at [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ac.uk/). For my final-year MSci research project, I worked alongside Dr. David Clements (Imperial), Dr. Chris Pearson (RAL), and Xinni Wu (Imperial) on data from [ESA's Herschel Space Observatory](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/home) to study the evolution of dusty star-forming galaxies. The *Herschel* mission has long since been decommissioned (2009&ndash;2013), so we applied some fancy statistical techniques to *squeeze* out as much science as possible from the legacy observations. Our first paper from this research has just been accepted for publication in the *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society* (MNRAS) Journal!

Outside of physics, I enjoy (film) photography, gaming, baking, knitting, art, crafting... and generally making things! You can find my photography portfolio here: [photo.thomasvarnish.co.uk](https://photo.thomasvarnish.co.uk/).

I created this website from scratch as a side project. It's built upon GitHub Pages and the Jekyll static-site framework, but all the HTML and CSS you see here was custom-written. All the code can be <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/{{ site.author.github }}.github.io">found on my GitHub</a>, so feel free to take a look if you're interested!
