## MIT News Article
MIT News published a <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/studying-astrophysically-relevant-plasma-physics-thomas-varnish-0703">feature article</a> about me and my research at the Plasma Science and Fusion Center. As a part of this, a short explainer video was produced, talking about my work!

## Research Featured in the News
Following the release of the first two papers from my MSci project, the Royal Astronomical Socitety provided a [press release](https://ras.ac.uk/news-and-press/research-highlights/hidden-galaxies-could-be-smoking-gun-universe-riddle), which was subsequently picked up by 24 news outlets from around the globe.
Our results were particularly exciting as they offered the deepest-ever far-infrared observations made by the Herschel Space Observatory.
Even more exciting, perhaps, is that our observations hinted at the possibility that we have have missed key aspects in our current understanding of galaxy evolution models!

## Editor's Pick in AIP Physics of Plasmas
My latest PhD work on studying guide-field magnetic reconnection in the lab was published earlier this year in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0251581">Physics of Plasmas journal</a>, and chosen as an Editor's Pick. An accompanying <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/10.0036049">popular science article</a> was published highlighting my work, and I was invited by the publisher to give a webinar summarizing the paper.
